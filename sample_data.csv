Rapid detection of antibiotic resistance in sepsis using PCR techniques,"In this study, we developed a rapid PCR-based test for detecting antibiotic resistance genes in patients with sepsis. The test demonstrated 95% sensitivity and 92% specificity in identifying common resistance mechanisms in bloodstream infections. Early detection of antimicrobial resistance could significantly improve treatment outcomes in severe sepsis cases.",Smith J.A.; Johnson K.L.; Lee M.H.,2021,Journal of Clinical Microbiology
Biomarkers for early diagnosis of septic shock,"This review examines current and emerging biomarkers for the early diagnosis of septic shock. We found that procalcitonin and C-reactive protein remain the most widely used markers, though novel approaches combining multiple biomarkers show promise for improved sensitivity.",Williams P.; Thompson R.,2020,Critical Care Medicine
Impact of machine learning on antibiotic stewardship programs,"Machine learning algorithms were applied to hospital prescription data to optimize antibiotic usage patterns. While the study did not specifically address sepsis cases, the framework developed could be adapted for various infectious conditions requiring antimicrobial therapy.",Chen X.; Garcia A.; Patel S.,2022,Health Informatics Journal
Novel point-of-care test for bacterial identification in sepsis,"A new point-of-care test was developed that can identify bacterial pathogens in bloodstream infections within 30 minutes. The test uses microfluidic technology and shows promising results in preliminary trials with sepsis patients. The rapid identification could help clinicians select appropriate antibiotics before resistance testing results are available.",Rodriguez M.T.; Khan S.; Patel N.,2021,Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease
Epidemiology of multidrug-resistant infections in the ICU,"This retrospective study examined the prevalence of multidrug-resistant infections in intensive care units across 15 hospitals. Sepsis caused by resistant organisms was associated with significantly higher mortality rates compared to susceptible strains. The study highlights the need for improved diagnostic approaches for early detection of resistance.",Cooper J.L.; Smithson A.; White T.R.,2019,American Journal of Infection Control
Sepsis management guidelines: a ten-year review,"A comprehensive review of sepsis management guidelines over the past decade, focusing on changes in diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations. The review does not specifically address antimicrobial resistance testing or novel diagnostics.",Brown A.C.; Wilson D.E.,2020,Journal of Emergency Medicine
Rapid molecular diagnostics for bloodstream infections,"This paper presents a novel LAMP-based technique for rapid detection of common pathogens in bloodstream infections. The test can simultaneously detect the presence of key antibiotic resistance genes, allowing for more appropriate empiric therapy in sepsis cases. Time to result was reduced from >24 hours with traditional culture to <2 hours.",Lee S.Y.; Ngyuen T.H.; Davidson J.K.,2022,Journal of Molecular Diagnostics
Clinical outcomes in sepsis: relation to antibiotic timing and appropriateness,"A retrospective analysis of 1,200 sepsis cases demonstrating that appropriate initial antibiotic therapy significantly reduces mortality. The study did not evaluate specific diagnostic technologies but emphasizes the importance of rapid identification of causative organisms and resistance patterns.",Gonzalez A.B.; Sharma S.; Mitchell P.L.,2020,International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents
Comparison of sepsis screening tools in the emergency department,"This study compared five different sepsis screening tools used in emergency departments. The research focused on clinical criteria for sepsis identification rather than laboratory diagnostics or antimicrobial resistance detection.",Johnson L.M.; Brooks K.S.,2021,Emergency Medicine Journal
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing for diagnosis of bloodstream infections,"Implementation of metagenomic NGS for diagnosis of bloodstream infections showed improved pathogen detection rates compared to conventional culture methods. The technology could also identify antimicrobial resistance genes, providing valuable information for sepsis treatment. However, the current turnaround time and cost remain barriers to widespread adoption.",Zhang W.; Li X.; Chen Y.; Wu Z.,2022,Clinical Infectious Diseases
The economic burden of sepsis-related antimicrobial resistance,"This economic analysis examines the additional healthcare costs associated with antimicrobial resistance in sepsis cases. While primarily focused on economic outcomes, the study highlights the potential value of rapid diagnostic tests that could identify resistance patterns early in the course of treatment.",Peterson E.J.; Thompson R.S.,2021,Health Economics Review
Development of a multiplexed PCR assay for detection of sepsis pathogens and resistance markers,"A new multiplexed PCR assay was developed that can simultaneously detect 20 common sepsis-causing pathogens and 15 antimicrobial resistance genes from blood samples. In a validation study with 250 sepsis patients, the assay demonstrated 92% concordance with conventional methods but delivered results in 3 hours versus 48-72 hours for traditional culture and susceptibility testing.",Kim J.H.; Li W.X.; Ramirez A.,2023,Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis
